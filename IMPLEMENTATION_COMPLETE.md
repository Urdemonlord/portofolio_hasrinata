## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Animation CSS Classes**
```css
/* Primary Animations */
.animate-slide-in-up        # Bottom to top slide
.animate-slide-in-left      # Left to right slide
.animate-fade-in-scale      # Fade with scale effect
.animate-float              # Floating effect
.animate-bounce-custom      # Custom bounce

/* Interactive Effects */
.hover-lift                 # Lift on hover
.card-hover                 # Card hover animation
.btn-dynamic               # Dynamic button effects
.hover-scale               # Scale on hover
.hover-glow                # Glow effect

/* Page & Navigation */
.page-transition           # Page entrance animation
